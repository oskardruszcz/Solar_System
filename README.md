# Solar System 3D Simulation

## Description
This is an interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System created using **Three.js**. The project visualizes the Sun, planets, and moons in their relative positions, orbits, and motions. Users can explore the Solar System in a dynamic and engaging way, offering smooth animations and realistic representations of the celestial bodies.

## Features
- **3D Solar System**: Realistic 3D rendering of the Solar System, including the Sun, planets, and moons.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate and zoom to explore the Solar System from different angles.
- **Realistic Orbits and Motions**: The planets move along their orbits with accurate scaling and relative distances.
- **Textures**: High-quality textures applied to the planets for a more immersive visual experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and animation.
- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and interactivity of the Solar System simulation.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   Change to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd solar-system

3. Install the dependencies
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (using `npm`):
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start the development server
   To start the local development server and run the project, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npx vite

5. Open the project in the browser
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should see the solar          system simulation running.

## Usage
Once the project is running, you will see a 3D simulation of the solar system in your browser. You can interact with the simulation in the following ways:
   - Explore the solar system: Use your mouse or trackpad to rotate and zoom in/out to explore different parts of the solar system.
   - Interactive features: Click on different planets to learn more about them (this can be added as a feature if you want).
   - Real-time updates: The simulation is dynamic, and you will see the planets orbiting around the sun in real-time.
