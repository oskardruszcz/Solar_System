# Solar System 3D Simulation

## Description
This is an interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System created using **Three.js**. The project visualizes the Sun, planets, and moons in their relative positions, orbits, and motions. Users can explore the Solar System in a dynamic and engaging way, offering smooth animations and realistic representations of the celestial bodies.

## Features
- **3D Solar System**: Realistic 3D rendering of the Solar System, including the Sun, planets, and moons.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate and zoom to explore the Solar System from different angles.
- **Realistic Orbits and Motions**: The planets move along their orbits with accurate scaling and relative distances.
- **Textures**: High-quality textures applied to the planets for a more immersive visual experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and animation.
- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and interactivity of the Solar System simulation.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   Change to the project folder:
   cd solar-system

3. Install the dependencies
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (using npm):
   npm install

4. Start the development server
   To start the local development server and run the project, use the following command:
   npx vite

5. Open the project in the browser
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should see the solar          system simulation running.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser to launch the 3D Solar System simulation.
Use the mouse or touchpad to interact with the scene:
  - Rotate the scene by dragging the mouse.
  - Zoom in and out using the scroll wheel or pinch gestures on a touchpad.
